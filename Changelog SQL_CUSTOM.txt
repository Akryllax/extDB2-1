	Added: String_Escape_Quotes
		Escapes " -> ""  ,   ' -> ''
		Added " to either end of string
		Example  aaa'bbb"dsadsd"  -> "aaa''bbb""dsadsd"""   so it will call compile correctly
		Useful for when storing + retreiving playernames from Database

	Added: Check_Add_Quotes (Input Only Option)
		This just adds "<value>" before running a sanitize check.
		Useful for when storing a string in database + you like to a check it, but you don't wont to store quotes wrapping the string.

	Added: Check_Add_Escape_Quotes (Input Only Option)
		This will escape the quotations (just like String_Escape_Quotes) before running a sanitize check.
		Useful for when storing strings in raw form and are retrieving via String_Escape_Quotes later on. e.g playernames

	Added: DateTime_ISO8601 (Output Only Option)
		Used to convert ISO8601 Format i.e "2015-05-13T20:16:24Z" to arma array [Year,Month,Day,Hour,Minute,Second] or [] for Null Entry
